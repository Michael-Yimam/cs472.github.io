    <div class="myStory-parent bodyText">

        <p id="myStory">
            I am Michael. A 26-year-old Ethiopian joining MUM to be a professional on my field and to become a better version of myself.
            I grow up with my two older sisters in the capital Addis Ababa where well over 4 million people live. Both of my sisters are
            now married and left our house a few years ago. I am the last one to left home for MUM. The reader might wonder why in the world,
            a 26-year-old, fully grown man lives with his parent? Would it make a difference If I told the reader...You!,
            that I knew a guy who lived with his parents for over 30 years?...... I guess Not.

        <p id="theRestOfTheStory" class="bodyText text">
            Well, here is the reason. Unlike American parents, Ethiopian parents are not able to kick out their kids after graduation these days,
            because of the skyrocketing housing prices; and I am talking about renting a house here not buying. Almost all fresh graduates,
            whether employed or unemployed end up living with their parents or relatives to get a roof above their heads. <br/>
            Leaving the city for small towns in search of affordable life is unthinkable to most; as moving out from the cities means an exponential
            decrease in basic infrastructure access like water, electricity, transportation and telephone service. However, this does not mean they
            are ... sorry ... we are completely dependent on them. In return, we cover the cost of food or utility bills. <br/>
            Now the awkward part is over, let me introduce my educational background and professional experience. In college, I studied Information
            technology and graduated with good enough GPA that could guarantee me a decent job. The four years I spent in college was the most rewarding
            times of my life. The environment I was in was collaborative, not competitive. There were tutorial classes to help struggling students,
            work-groups to tackle challenging assignments and study hours to prepare for examinations. It taught me a life lesson of being good to everyone
            and giving a helping hand to anyone who needs it most; then God, Allah, Universe ... or whatever anyone believes is out there will pay us hundred folds.
            Although it does not guarantee us a hundredfold return policy, Newton's Third Law of Motion 'Action and Reaction' makes sense here. Whatever we give we shall receive in return. <br/>
            While I was in college, I worked part-time as a software developer for a small clinic and then worked for 6 months as an intern for Ethiopian Electric utility on the same software
            development position as I did before. I participated actively inside the software developers team, which was developing a resource planning software at the time. <br/>
            What I set my goal, when I first joined MUM was to graduate and still is. However, after starting my CPT or OPT I have a plan to take some engineering courses in fields like Electrical and Mechanical engineering.
            I have always had the interest to design affordable devices that can be used to solve real problems in my country and I am sure software knowledge solely will not do
            the job. Electrical, Mechanical, and Software engineering are like a tripod, which supports each other and are behind every device that we use today. For example,
            I was in Wall-mart a week ago and I saw a cashier machine which took a cash for payment and gave me back my change without any hiccup in the process.
            That is all I wanted to do for my country. Helping my people make their day to day task much easier and less labor, time and resource consuming,
            rather than trying to create the next big thing, the next Google, the next Facebook .... e.t.c. <br/>
            It is always better and more humane to see what is needed and provide a solution for it than to create a need
            that was not here before and supply the solution, which is what most technology companies are doing.

                            Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal, and his team set out on a mission to capture or
                            kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah, in late June 2005. After running into
                            mountain herders and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow
                            their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight
                            for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare.

                            two special forces ambushed on an Afghani ridge await rescue as Taliban forces close in;
                            a poli-sci professor at a California college invites a promising student to re-engage.
                            Decisions press upon the reporter, the student, and the soldiers.

                            You are being watched. The government has a secret system:
                            a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
                            I know, because I built it. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,
                            but it sees everything. Violent crimes involving ordinary people;
                            people like you. Crimes the government considered 'irrelevant'.
                            They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. But I needed a partner,
                            someone with the skills to intervene. Hunted by the authorities,
                            we work in secret. You'll never find us, but victim or perpetrator,
                            if your number's up... we'll find you.
