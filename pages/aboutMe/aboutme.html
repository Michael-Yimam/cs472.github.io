        <p id="myStory">
            I am Michael. A 26-year-old Ethiopian joining MUM to be a professional on my field and to become a better version of myself.
            I grow up with my two older sisters in the capital Addis Ababa where well over 4 million people live. Both of my sisters are
            now married and left our house a few years ago. I am the last one to left home for MUM. The reader might wonder why in the world,
            a 26-year-old, fully grown man lives with his parent? Would it make a difference If I told the reader...You!,
            that I knew a guy who lived with his parents for over 30 years?...... I guess Not. <a id="moreAnchor" href="">More</a>
